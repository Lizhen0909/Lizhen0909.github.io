I am a Ph.D candidate in Computer Science at Florida State University, under the guidance of Dr. Michael Mascagni. Prior to joining FSU, I got my M.S.in computer science from Auburn university in 2015 and my B.S. in Computer Science from North China Electric University in 2007.

My current research focuses on how to leverage big data and machine learning technologies to solve challenges in DNA sequence analysis. As part of this work, I also work under the supervision of Dr. Zhong Wang, a group lead at DOE Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley national lab.
